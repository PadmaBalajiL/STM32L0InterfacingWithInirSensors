# STM32L0InterfacingWithInirSensors

The aim of this project is to connect two air pollution sensors of SGX Sensortech- INIR CD5% and ME100% wit STM32L073RZ nucleo board.

Data is collected to be used for analysis and the format used to collect data is given below
<adcValue1>;<convertedVdc1>;<ppm1>;<adcValue1>;<convertedVdc1>;<ppm1>;

The datasheet of the sensors and other useful files can be found in the following links
